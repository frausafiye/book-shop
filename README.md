# bookShopper
an e-commerce project created using React (+Redux)
This is a project that I enjoyed producing very much, and learned new things from the problems I encountered in this process.
I used functional components, hooks and redux. (I keep the version of the same project that I developed using contex-API at the local repository.)
I also used react-thunk for asynchronous functions and store the products that are added to favorites or cart in localStorage.
The payment process is not ready yet.
If you have browsed my project and have suggestions or critique I would be happy to receive your feedback.(my email:s_gulenc@outlook.com)
