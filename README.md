# Book Shop

is an e-commerce project created using React (+Redux).
This is a project that I enjoyed producing very much, and learned new things from the problems I encountered in this process.
I used functional components, hooks and redux together with react-thunk for for asynchronous actions.
The payment can be done with Paypal.
If you have browsed my project and have suggestions or critique I would be happy to receive your feedback to my email address (s_gulenc@outlook.com).
